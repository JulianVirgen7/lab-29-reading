## What did I learn?

I learned about the different types of categories in statements and declarations. 
These ctegories were control flow, declarations, functions and classes, and iterations.
I also learned that do...while in code Creates a loop that executes a specified statement
until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing 
the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.
